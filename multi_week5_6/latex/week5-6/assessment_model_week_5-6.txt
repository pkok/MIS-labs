Assessment guidelines for assignment 3: Image Classification
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: this week you can earn 20 points, so your mark is (#points / 2)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q1. Implement k-NN classifier
	
	Maximum
		1 point
	
	Evaluation
		[1 point]	All steps are implemented and correct answers

Q2. Different k-NN strategy
	
	Maximum
		2 points
	
	Evaluation
		[2 points] 	A different strategy is well explained, implemented and compared to default 
		[1 point] 	only implemented and compared, or
		[1 point] 	only described and explained

Q3. Implement mean class accuracy

	Maximum
		1 point
	
	Evaluation
		[1 point] 	Correct implementation

Q4. Cross validation of K

	Maximum
		2 points
	
	Evaluation
		[2 points] 	Cross validation is performed well, and well described
		[1 point] 	Several values for k are evaluated, but not the correct procedure, and
				a single (possibly suboptimal) value is chosen and described

Q5. Evaluation of 4 possible classifiers

	Maximum
		2 point
	
	Evaluation
		[2 points] 	The visualization is good and the observations are correct for all 4
		[1 point] 	Only 2 or 3 classifiers are discussed, but observations are correct, or
		[1 point]	All visualisations are correct, but observations are missing

Q6. Use scikit

	Maximum
		1 point
	
	Evaluation
		[1 point] 	Correct call to scikit library

Q7. Ring data - linear SVM

	Maximum
		1 points

	Evaluation
		[1 point] 	Good observations, correct class accuracy and nice drawing


Q8. Non linear transformations

	Maximum
		2 points

	Evaluation
		[2 points] 	Two different non-linear transformations 
		[1 point] 	A single non-linear transformation

Q9. Transform to polar coordinates

	Maximum
		1 points

	Evaluation
		[1 point] 	Correct answer and good visualisation

Q10. Non-linear SVM

	Maximum
		2 points

	Evaluation
		[2 point] 	Correct visualisations (original space, polar space) and class accuracies 
		[1 point] 	Missing a visualisation, or
		[1 point] 	good visualisations, but incorrect class accuracies

Q11. Image Classification - Linear SVM

	Maximum
		3 points

	Evaluation
		[3 points]	Correct answer: cross validation of C, different codebook sizes, correct class accuracies, well described
		[2 points]   	Correct answers, but no clear descriptions
		[1 point] 	No cross validation (but different codebook sizes), or
		[1 point] 	A single codebook size (but cross validation)

Q12. Image Classification - Discussing the results

	Maximum
		1 points

	Evaluation
		[1 point] 	Good observations and visualisations of the best and worst performing classes

Q13. Image Classification - Comparison kNN vs SVM

	Maximum
		1 points

	Evaluation
		[1 point] 	Good observations and visualisations of the differences between kNN and SVM for different codebook sizes


******************
Bonus
******************
You can do a *single* bonus question, for correct implementation and description of the bonus you get 2 points, so you can obtain an 11 in stead of a 10.

The topics to choose are:
a) The kernel trick
b) Learning the SVM weight vector
c) Multi-class image classification

Please post on Piazza if youâ€™re interested in doing a bonus, no later than Thursday dec 12th 23:59.
The bonus will be provided within a day
